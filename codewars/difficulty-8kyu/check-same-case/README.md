## Check same case

Write a function that will check if two given characters are the same case.

-   If either of the characters is not a letter, return  `-1`
-   If both characters are the same case, return  `1`
-   If both characters are letters, but not the same case, return  `0`

### Examples
```ruby
a  and  g  returns  1
A  and  C  returns  1
b  and  G  returns  0
B  and  g  returns  0
0  and  ?  returns -1
```
